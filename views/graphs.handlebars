    <h3>Internet Speeds Around the World</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/graphs/SouthAmerica">South America</a></li>
      <li><a href="/graphs/SouthEastAsia">South East Asia</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Motivation Behind The Project:</h4>
    <p>Internet speeds have been making stead improvements in terms of availablity, download speed, and quality. As part of a seperate project, I was interested in how the speeds had changed over time, not for a single country alone, but for a region as a whole. Had some regions progressed faster that other regions? With-in a region did some countries made faster improvements than others? Our initial explorations into the data yeilded deeper questions that we are now undertaking.</p>

    <h3>US Media Response to New Virus Outbreaks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong><a href="#">All Outbreaks</a></strong></li>
      <li><a href="#">Bird Flu (2008)</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">H1N1 (2010)</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Ebola (2014)</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Motivation Behind The Project:</h4>
    <p>It seems that the media response to reports of new virus strains or outbreaks has been icreasing in intensity over the years. Is this passing observation true or unfounded? In this project we tried to objectively measure responses to each new or imagined virus outbreaks.</p>
